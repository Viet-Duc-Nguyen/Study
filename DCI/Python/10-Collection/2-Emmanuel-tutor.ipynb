    "TASK 1:\n",
    "You are working for a company as a Junior Software Developer and you have been tasked to \n",
    "build add new functionality to a new dating site the company is building to check for years \n",
    "of a user before allowing them to create an account.\n",
    "NOTE: The minimum age of a user should be 18 and the maximum age should be 150 \n",
    "years\n",
    "1.    Create a function named get_user_age that takes “date_of_birth” a string as an \n",
    "argument. The format of the date of birth should be “DDDD-MMMM-YYYY”, day, month and \n",
    "year. The function returns an integer which represents the age of the user\n",
    "2.   You should convert the date of birth string we get from the function, to a datetime \n",
    "object.\n",
    "3.   Declare variable named “num_of_days” that holds the value current date minus the \n",
    "date_of_birth.\n",
    "4.   Divide the num_of_daysby (365.2425- number of days in a year) and this should be \n",
    "the return value of the function.\n",
    "5.   Create another function that takes \"age_of_user\" an integer as an argument to \n",
    "function age_checker.\n",
    "6.   age_checker function does the checks below:\n",
    "o  if the age is less than 18, print \"\\nYou need to be 18 years and above to \n",
    "create an account.\\n\" and return 0\n",
    "o  if the age is greater than 150, print \"\\nYou need to be 150 years or younger \n",
    "to create an account.\\n\" and return 0\n",
    "o  else, print \"\\nYou are {age_of_user} years old, you can create an account\\n \n",
    "and return 1\n",
    "7.   create a function called “get_user_info()” takes zero parameters and prompts a user \n",
    "for the \"first name, last name, username and email\" and prints this values using a f \n",
    "string.\n",
    "8.   Great, now we have 3 functions, one gives us the age of the user, the other validates \n",
    "the age and one gets the user info. Now let’s add a way to prompt a user for their \n",
    "date of birth.\n",
    "9.   Declare a variable named attempts that holds the value 5, this will hold the number \n",
    "of attempts the user should try to enter their date of birth.\n",
    "10. Write a while loop the checks if the attempts are greater than 0 \n",
    "11. Inside the while loop declare a variable that uses the input function to get the \n",
    "birthdate in the terminal then declare another variable named age that holds the \n",
    "age by invoking “get_user_age(“date of birth string we get from prompting user”) “.\n",
    "12. Now use the value of the age variable which is the age of the user in an if \n",
    "statetement to check, If the value “age_checker(age of user)” equals to 1 invoke \n",
    "“get_user_info()” and break else decrement attempts and continue prompting until \n",
    "attempts equals to zero."
