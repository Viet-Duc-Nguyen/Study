- Built-in functions
    -print() input() isinstance() max() min() round()

- Built-in module, part of the Python standard library
    -import math
    -math.cell() math.floor()

- Operators
    - + / % = += -= *= ...

- Computers and Numbers
    - Decimal Numbers     
        0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
        'base 10 numbers' - 10 different characters
        We add an extra 1 in front and start again from 0
            9 -> 10
        Once our second number reaches 9 and want to add one
        We increment the second number and start again from 0
            19 -> 20
            99 -> 100

    - Hexadecimal numbers
        0, 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
        'Base 16 numbers'
        When counting up we reach F and want to add one
        We add an extra 1 in front and start again from 0
            F -> 10
            19 -> 1A
            1A -> 1B
            1B -> 1C
        All the way up to FFm which is 255
            FF -> 100
        
    - Binary Numbers
        Numbers that use the characters 0,1
        Also called base 2 numbers
        Because there are 2 diff characters
        When counting up we reach 1 and want to add one
            0, 1 , 10
            0
            1
            10
            11
            100
            101
            110
            111
            1000
            1001
            1010
            1011
            1111
            10000...
        Computers work in binary
            - This is a simplification
            - Each file is made up of ones and zeroes
            - We call one 1 or 0 a 'bit'
            - 8 bit = 8 characters of 1 or 0
            - Each file is a list of 1 and 0
            - Usually we talk about file sizes in 'kilobytes' or 'megabytes'

        One byte is 8 bits
            - 1 kilobyte is 1000 bytes
            - 1 kilobyte is 1024 bytes (SOMETIMES, DEPENDS ON WHO YOU ASK)

            - 1 megabyte is 1000 kilobytes
            - 1 megabyte is 1024 kilobytes

            - Mibibytes (MiB) is a unit of digital information storage, which is equal to 1,048,576 bytes.
            - Kibibytes (KiB) is a unit of digital information equal to 1024 bytes. 

            - 1000 megabytes is... 1 gigabyte
            - 1000 gigabytes is... 1 terabyte






    - Bits and Bytes
    - Binary number operations
    - Conditionals
    - A little chaos
