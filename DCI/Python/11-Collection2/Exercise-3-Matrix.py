Given a matrix represented as a list of lists and a vector represented as a list, compute their product using list comprehensions in Python.
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]]
vector = [1, 2, 3]
### Exercise:Given two lists of numbers, compute their scalar product using a list comprehension in Python.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = [5, 6, 7, 8]
scalar_product = ________
print(scalar_product) # Output: 70
